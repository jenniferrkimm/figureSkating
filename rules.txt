You should eat and exercise before competing.
You can compete without doing these, but your final score won't be as high.
Each task within the eat and gym menu options requires completion of an activity.
Getting the activity right increases points; getting it wrong decreases or doesn't increase points as much.

EAT:
    - You're given the option to go to a restaruant or make your own food.
    - It's recommended to order everything at the restaurant (except for the odd item) AND make your own food, as doing so correctly will increase points.
    - You will have enough money to buy everything unless you repeatedly order the odd item or buy an unwanted ingredient an unusual amount of times.
    - You can only make your own food and order each food (other than the odd food, see above) at the restaurant ONCE per play.
    - You earn focus, confidence, and energy points from food, which are factored into your final score based on a multiplier. Money is not factored in the score.
*side notes*
    - There are 3 food txt files with different food scenarios. 
    - Each time you play, it's randomized which txt file is read (i.e you'll get a random set of foods).
    - Each food has different focus & energy point values and different prices associated with them. 
    - You can only earn confidence points by making your own food.

GYM:
    - At the gym, you will train by running. 
    - You earn preparation and health points from training, which are factored into your final score based on a multiplier.
    - You can only train ONCE per play.

COMPETE:
    - You'll be given 3 rounds of patterns, & using the keypad (w a s d) you will "skate" the pattern.
    - You start with 50 points, & each wrong move subtracts 1.
    - You finish the game after round 3, & you can view your final results in out.txt.

TRIVIA:
    - There are 2 trivia sets (each with 10 questions) you can play for fun that don't factor into your final score.
    - You can play trivia as many times as you want; each time you play, the question order is randomized.
